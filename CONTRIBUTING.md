# Contribute for better code and features
Thanks for your interest in contributing to Ziggy! To keep things running smoothly we ask you to follow a few guidelines when contributing.

## Open an Issue.
If you have an idea for a feature, we'd prefer you open an issue before going to the trouble if writing code. We welcome your ideas. If your idea for a feature or just for better code will help to improve Ziggy, we proud that and will implement that at the next release.

## Testing the Code
Ziggy use [Orchestra Testbench](http://orchestraplatform.com/docs/latest/components/testbench/) as our base Phpunit TestCase for testing PHP and [Mocha](https://mochajs.org) for testing our JavaScript.
